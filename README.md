# Memory Game Project

## Description
Browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration).

## Instructions
Clone the project from GitHub or download and unpack it. To launch the game open `index.html` file in your browser. To start the game, simply click one of the cards to *open* it and reveal its symbol. Click a second card to find a match for that symbol. If you do find a match, those cards stay *open*. If you don't find a match, they *close*. To win the game you have to match all the cards.

At the top there is score panel that displays:

 - star rating (gets lower the more moves you make)
 - move counter
 - timer (starts once one of the cards is clicked)

On the right of the score panel there is 'Restart' button, which resets all of the above and shuffles the cards.
